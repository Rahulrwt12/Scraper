AC Input PCB Mount

Advanced Energy produces both a range of ACDC modules with a power rating of 500 watts and a family of power factor correction (PFC) modules with power ratings from 75 to 2,400 watts.The PFC modules are designed to operate from an input of universal AC-mains voltage andÂ feed one or more downstream high voltage isolated DC-DC converters, which then provide the low voltages required by the application. This modular approach provides customers with a cost-effective and efficient means of implementing high-voltage DC power distribution systems and application-specific low profile power supplies. Typical applications include transport and avionic systems.The ACDC modules are designed to accept wide-range AC-input and convert to low-voltage DC output. They are particularly applicable in contact-cooling applications that require low-profile power solutions. They have a focused feature set that has been defined to enable applications to be realized as easily as possible.

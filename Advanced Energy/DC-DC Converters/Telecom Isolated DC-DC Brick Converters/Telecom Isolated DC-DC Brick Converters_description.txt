Telecom Isolated DC-DC Brick Converters

Artesyn Embedded Power produces an extensive range of industry standard brick type isolated DC-DC converters for telecommunications applications. Offering power outputs from 35 to 600 watts, it includes models with sixteenth-, eighth-, quarter- and half-brick form factors that cover virtually every requirement. All these converters offer a wide choice of voltage variants and most of them have options available for surface-mount or through-hole terminations and are open-frame designs that can be fitted with an optional baseplate for enhanced thermal performance. We also produce a growing range of eighth-, half- and full-brick isolated DC-DC converters designed specifically to produce the regulated low noise DC supply required for RF power amplifiers in wireless base stations and similar telecommunications applications. Offering power outputs from 100 to 800 watts, they cover all power levels required for applications from pico to macro base stations.

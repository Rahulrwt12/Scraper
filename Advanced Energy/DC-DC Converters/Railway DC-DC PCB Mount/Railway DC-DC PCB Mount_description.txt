Railway DC-DC PCB Mount

Advanced Energy's high-performance ERM family of DC-DC converter modules is specifically designed to meet the power demands and safety standards of railway rolling stock applications. These units, encapsulated in a compact quarter-brick form factor with a metal base-plate, boast an advanced circuit topology that delivers up to 92% efficiency. The ERM family is protected from atmospheric conditions without the need for additional conformal coating, and the isolated base-plate can accommodate an optional heat sink or be used for cold-wall mounting.Featuring a reinforced insulation system suitable for high voltage input and low voltage output, along with high EMC immunity, the ERM family is qualified for various demanding embedded power applications in railway and other transportation systems. Compliant with railway industry specifications EN 50155 and 50121-3-2, and tested to the vibration and thermal shock requirements of EN 61373, it is perfect for applications such as engine management, traction control, door control, video surveillance, communications, entertainment, lighting, and other on-board electrical equipment.

Ohmmeters & Bond Meters

The TEGAM line of bond meters, milli-ohmmeters, and high-speed micro-ohmmeters offer performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. TEGAM bond meters are routinely used on aircraft production lines and for regular airframe maintenance checks, where electrical and mechanical joint integrity is critically important. The TEGAM 1750 high-speed micro-ohmmeter is frequently used on production lines and in QA labs at electronic component manufacturers, automotive manufacturers, and a in a wide variety of industrial applications. Additonally, TEGAM offers several models of mega-ohmmeters, commonly referrred to as insulation testers, which are used for measuring high resistance levels.

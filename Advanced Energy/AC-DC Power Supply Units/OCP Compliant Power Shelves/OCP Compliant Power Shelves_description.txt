OCP Compliant Power Shelves

Advanced Energy, dedicated to high-quality, efficient, and reliable power solutions, proudly presents its Open Compute Project (OCP) compliant power products. The latest, the ORv3 HPR PSU, a testament to our commitment to innovation, meets the rigorous requirements of modern data centers. The ORv3 HPR 5.5kW PSU and shelf not only meet the target efficiency requirements but also operate with very high power factor while under dynamic loading conditions typical of AI/ML workloads. Multiple 33kW shelves can be operated in parallel, providing reliable and efficient power, its high-performance design enables optimal operation of servers and networking equipment while reducing the burden on the data center power infrastructure. Built with state-of-the-art technology, it sets industry standards for performance.The ORV3 3kW PSU and 18kW Power Shelf represent the original narrow range 48V OCP power concept. The 18kW power shelf, with efficiency approaching 98%, can be paired with an 18kW battery shelf with regulated discharge, thereby enabling a narrow bus voltage range which allows higher efficiency in the down stream conversion for the IT loads.AE is also a proud producer of the OCP ORV2 12V PSU and shelf. The ORV2 PSU produces 3.3kW output power. The ORV2 shelf is a combined power and battery back-up shelf and has bays for 3 PSUs and 3 BBUs.

AC Input PCB Mount

Advanced Energyâ€™s Artesyn produces an extensive and rapidly growing range of small isolated DC-DC converters for low-power industrial applications in areas such as automation, instrumentation, test and measurement, and telecommunications. Our portfolio of industrial DC-DC converters for low-power, low-voltage applications comprises four different families, all of which are suitable for ruggedized applications in harsh environments. Fully encapsulated and housed in metal cases for robustness, these units accommodate a wide operating temperature range and feature high-efficiency and high-power density designs. Spanning power ratings from 3 to 50 W, with single and dual outputs from +/-15 to 24 V, the converters feature wide input voltage ranges for maximum design-in flexibility.
